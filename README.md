# Stock-Analysis
Module 2 work
#### Overview of Project
  Steve has asked me to build a workbook for him so he can analyze stocks on behalf of his parents. Steve's parents are intrigued by a company known as Daqo (DQ) and would like Steve's opinion on the investment option.  Upon further analysis , DQ may not be the best investment option for Steve's parents.  Steve has asked for a workbook that easily calculates basic stock characteristics for 12 companies (including DQ) that might be a better opportunity.  This Workbook needs to be adjustable, and run properly in a reletively short period of time.
  
### **2018 Stock Performance versus 2017**
2018 was a rough year for the selected stocks, including DQ.  The stocks that showed the most promise were ENPH and RUN as you can see in the graph below.

2017 was a much better year for the selected stocks.

DQ has a phenomenal year in 2017 but gave back a good portion of those gains in 2018.  ENPH and RUN have shown two consecutive years of positive growth and might warrant a deeper dive to discover if they may be better investment options for Steve's parents than DQ.

### **Performance of the Script**
Speed and successful execution of the worksheet was an important factor for Steve.  The origional script was run theough the workbook named Green_Stocks.  This workbook successfully provided the information that Steve was looking for. The workbook produced the 2018 results in 0.59375 seconds.

The 2017 results were produced in 1.023438 seconds.

The workbook was refactored and the coding was completed more efficiently.  The new workbook was called VBA Challenge and the speed of the results, somewhat, improved.

There was a marked improvement especially in the 2017 results.

### **Summary**
Refactoring the workbook allow for two disctinct changes.

  1.) The code itself was written in a more condensed fashion that allowed for less space to be used by the code, and as a result, will make future edits to the code easier.
  
  2.) The code took less time to run.
